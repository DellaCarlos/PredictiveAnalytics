# Predictive Analysis for Activity Demand Forecasting

This project is a **Python-based predictive analytics system** designed to estimate the **number of activities expected to be received** over a given period. It uses historical data and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and generate forecasts that support planning and decision-making.

The main goal is to help organizations anticipate workload, optimize resource allocation, and improve operational efficiency through data-driven predictions.

## Project Objective

* Predict the **future quantity of incoming activities**
* Analyze historical trends and seasonality
* Support strategic and operational planning
* Reduce uncertainty in demand forecasting

---

## Key Features

* Data preprocessing and cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature engineering
* Predictive modeling using machine learning
* Model evaluation and performance metrics

## Approach

The project follows a typical **data science workflow**:

1. **Data Collection** – Historical activity data
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values and outliers
3. **Exploratory Analysis** – Understanding trends and patterns
4. **Feature Engineering** – Creating meaningful input variables
5. **Model Training** – Building predictive models
6. **Evaluation** – Measuring accuracy and reliability
7. **Prediction** – Estimating future activity volumes

## Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python
* **Data Manipulation**: pandas, numpy
* **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
* **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn
* **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / Python scripts

---

## Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated using common regression metrics, such as:

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* R² Score

These metrics help assess prediction accuracy and reliability.
